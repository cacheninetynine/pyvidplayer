# pyvidplayer
A video player for anything that can display characters and run python (also import some python libraries because we need it and yes i am trying to make this as long as possible)

## Usage
For usage you need:
1. A video file converted to images
2. Python3 interpreter
3. A keyboard

## Command line arguments:
1. start - The path to the folder and any symbols before the frame number
2. vidlen - Amount of frames
3. fps - fps
4. colormode (bw/color) - Video color mode. BW is faster, but color is... colorful but slower

## Example
Linux: `python3 pyvidplayer.py ./BADAPPLE30/0_ 6474 30 bw`

## Notes
If the terminal columns are NOT even, the video will be displayed wrong
